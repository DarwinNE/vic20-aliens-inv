# vic20-aliens-inv

By Davide Bucci

This program is a Space-Invaders clone that runs on an unexpanded VIC-20

The objective is not to reproduce perfectly the original game, but more to
propose something very playable and quite fast on the VIC-20. Arcadia has been
inspiring, even if the gameplay is very different from Space Invaders.

I took some screenshots during the development of the game.

![This is the very first screenshots (April 23, 2018). Static aliens, some graphic errors and an Arcadia-style screen size.](https://github.com/DarwinNE/vic20-aliens-inv/raw/master/screenshots/vic20_spaceinvaders_1.png)

![Cannon and aliens (April 26, 2018). Movement on aliens. Score is a placeholder, no real code handles that. ](https://github.com/DarwinNE/vic20-aliens-inv/raw/master/screenshots/vic20_spaceinvaders_2.png)

![Cannon and aliens (April 29, 2018). Aliens move and drop bombs. The cannon can be moved and there are four bunkers. ](https://github.com/DarwinNE/vic20-aliens-inv/raw/master/screenshots/vic20_spaceinvaders_3.png)
