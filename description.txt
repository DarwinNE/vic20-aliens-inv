This program is a Space-Invaders clone that runs on an unexpanded VIC-20.
It has been successfully tested on PAL and NTSC real machines.

The objective is not to reproduce perfectly the original game, but more to
propose something very playable and quite fast on the VIC-20. Arcadia has been
inspiring, even if its gameplay is very different from Space Invaders.

As in the original Space Invaders, you have to shoot to the aliens that try to
land on the Earth, avoiding the mortal bombs they drop. You have four bunkers
that provide a certain degree of protection, but they will not withstand bombs
(or your shoots) for very long...

There are less aliens than in the original arcade version of Space Invaders,
however, the game tends to became quite frantic after a while.

A certain amount of work has been done to ensure that the graphics is smooth
enough so that the effect hopefully appears to be quite polished. It is my
first attempt to write a complete game in 6502 assembly language, even if I
learnt that language many years ago and I used it mainly as a complement for
BASIC programs.

This game has been physically distributed in a limited edition of three C-10
deluxe cassettes tapes that now are highly sought collector items :-)

I hope you will enjoy this little game as I enjoyed programming it!
